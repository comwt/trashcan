      The following changes were made for Trash Can version 2.3:
      <p><u><b>Trash Script:</b></u><br>
      <blockquote>
        <em>BUGFIX:</em> &nbsp; Added the '-A' option to the ls call in the -list section of the script. &nbsp;This allows you to see files where their names begin with a dot [.] when there are no unhidden files in the trashcan.
