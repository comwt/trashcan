<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<br>
The following changes were made for Trash Can version 1.2:
<p><u><b>Installation Script:</b></u><br>
<ul>
  <li>Added code to allow for ease of future un-installion by USER (gives the trash_uninstall script something to go by).</li>
</ul></p>
<p><u><b>Executable:</b></u><br>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed a bug created by the last modification of code (for last year's trash not deleting correctly) where a variable was being reset for the DEL_ARRAY[@] - all works as it should now.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><u><b>Un-Install Script:</b></u><br>
<ul>
  <li>This is a new feature of Trash Can</li>
  <li>You must first re-install Trash Can 1.2 over your previously installed version for it to work</li>
  <li>Re-Installing will not delete your old trash since the install script recognizes its existance.</li>
</ul>
