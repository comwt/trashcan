      The following changes were made for Trash Can version 2.2:
      <p><u><b>Trash Script:</b></u><br>
      <blockquote>
        <em>BUGFIX:</em> &nbsp; Re-write of 'empty' section to better handle permanently deleting all trash. &nbsp;The code now allows for deleting filenames that begin with a dot (i.e. ".profile_old").
        <br><em>ENHANCEMENT:</em> &nbsp; Added code to 'purge' section to notify user of files that will be deleted by name, then waits for approval.
      </blockquote>
