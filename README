DESCRIPTION:

  Trash Can is a recycle bin implementation for the command line. It is a set
  of scripts that can be run with ksh, bash, or zsh. It has commands for file
  removal, file restoration (to the original path), permanent deletion of
  particular files from the trash can, automatic purging of trash that is more
  than a certain number of days old, completely emptying the trash can,
  configuring trash can storage capacity, and displaying trash can disk usage.
  Trash is compressed to take up less room.
