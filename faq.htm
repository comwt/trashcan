<p><strong>1)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q1">Why</a> does nothing happen when I execute the &acute;purge&acute; command?</em></font><br>

   <blockquote>The feature &acute;purge&acute; is meant to run once a day, for your convenience.<br>
   Once it runs, on the first occurence of the day, it will update a <br>
   status field in trash.conf.  This in turn lets trash.sh know that<br>
   purge has already been run if you have subsequent logins or what not.<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>


   
<p><strong>2)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q2">&quot;bash:</a> purge: command not found&quot; - why is this happening?</em></font>
 
   <blockquote>This appears to be some sort of Bash version problem.  The only occurrences<br>
   I&acute;ve seen this happen with appear to be RedHat Linux 7.* related where the<br>
   user installed trashcan using .bashrc as their profile.  If you encounter<br>
   this error, uninstall the trashcan and then re-install using .bash_profile<br>
   instead of .bashrc.   (If you find another disto of linux where this is<br>
   happening, please let me know so I can jot them down.)<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>

   
<p><strong>3)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q3">&quot;Trying</a> to install and get &quot;Syntax error: `==&acute; is not expected.&quot;</em></font>
 
   <blockquote>You are probably using some sort of BSD version of linux or AIX.  These like<br>
   to use what is commonly known as the assignment operator &quot;=&quot; for string equality<br>
   testing, instead of the c-type &quot;==&quot;.  A fix has been made for the not-yet-released<br>
   version of trashcan (3.0), but if you would like to use trashcan until then, try modifying<br>
   trash_install, trash_uninstall and contents/trash.sh with the following SED command<br><br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>sed -e '^[^.awk]*if /==/=/g' trash_install > SED_Temp.out; mv SED_Temp.out trash_install</strong><br><br><br> 
   Of course, &quot;trash_install&quot; will need to be replaced with the other two files names respectively.<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>

   
<p><strong>4)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q4">What</a> is affected in my filesystem when I install trashcan?</em></font>

   <ol type="a"><li>The profile you chose (i.e.  .bashrc, .bash_profile, .profile) had<br>
      aliases for trashcan specific commands written to it.</li>
   <li>A new directory was created (i.e.  ~/.trash, ~/.trash2), which contains<br>
      everything else.</li>
   <li>trash.sh could also be in a /bin directory depending on if you<br>
      installed as &acute;root&acute; and chose that option instead of your home<br>
      directory.</li></ol>

   <blockquote><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>
   
   
<p><strong>5)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q5">How</a> can I manually delete/uninstall trashcan?</em></font>

   <ol type="a"><li>Edit the profile you chose during installation, removing the trashcan aliases<br>
      and the call of purge.</li>
   <li>Delete the .trash directory that was created using one of the following<br>
      commands:<br><br>

        /usr/bin/rm -fr ~/.trash<br>
        /bin/rm -fr ~/.trash</li><br><br>

   <li>If trash.sh was installed by root in a /bin directory, it needs to<br>
      be deleted.</li></ol>

<p><strong>6)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q6">Help!</a> &nbsp;The uninstall script does not work...</em></font>

   <blockquote>Sorry about this folks, I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote<br>
   trash_uninstall. &nbsp;Until trashcan-3.0 is finished, try manually uninstalling<br>
   trashcan as described above. &nbsp;Or you could edit trash_uninstall changing<br>
   the word 'root' to your login name (that <em>should</em> work).<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>
<!--
   <blockquote>Sorry about this folks, I have no idea what I was thinking when I wrote the<br>
   pre trashcan-3.0 uninstall script.  Likely, you are using an old version,<br>
   so just install the latest version, then you should have no problem<br>
   uninstalling.<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>
-->

   
<p><strong>7)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q7">Will</a> trashcan ever run under csh (C shell), sh (bourne shell) or the like?</em></font>

   <blockquote>Honestly, I don&acute;t program in those shells, but from what I&acute;ve seen it would<br>
   require a complete re-write of trashcan for each shell.  So, being the time<br>
   comprehensive (lazy) person that I am, I will not be translating it to other<br>
   shells.<br><br>

   HOWEVER,<br><br>

   As a remedy (and hopefully this pleases you folks), I am currently in the<br>
   process of writing a Perl version! &nbsp;&nbsp;:-o<br><br>

   I will, of course, keep maintaining the bash related version too.<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>

   
<p><strong>8)</strong> &nbsp;<font color="#dd0000"><em><a name="q8">I</a> found some bugs, what do I do?</em></font>

   <blockquote>Well, first off, are you using the latest version?  If not, just go grab<br>
   yourself a copy of it, install it, and see if it fixes your problem.<br><br>

   If you are using the latest version, please feel free to email me with<br>
   details of the error.  I plan on releasing a --debug option on one of the<br>
   upcoming releases so that we can have all kinds of nifty explanitory<br>
   output, which you could just copy and paste in an email to me.<br><br><a href="#TOP">top</a></blockquote></p>
